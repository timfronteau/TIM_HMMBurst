STEP 1 (HMM inferred on all subjects):
|_ (10delays x 4IC)  x ( 7s x 256/3 Hz x SUM_subj(N_subj trials) )
            -------------> TDE-HMM ( 1 Gaussian obs. model per state, 3 to 6 states )
            		    # Randomly initialising the HMM parameters (means, covars, startprob and transmat. see hmmlearn doc)
            
STEP 2 (subject by subject refining):
|_ (10delays x 4IC)  x ( 7s x 256/3 Hz x N_subj trials )
            -------------> TDE-HMM ( 1 Gaussian obs. model per state, 3 to 6 states )
            		    # Using the params found with step 1 for the Initialisation
